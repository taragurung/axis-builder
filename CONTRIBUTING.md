# How to contribute

Community made patches, localisations, bug reports and contributions are always welcome and are crucial to ensure Axis Builder remains the #1 builder for WordPress ;)

When contributing please ensure you follow the guidelines below so that we can keep on top of things.

__Note:__

GitHub is for *bug reports and contributions only* - if you have a support question or a request for a customization don't post here. Use [AxisThemes Support](http://support.axisthemes.com) for customer support, [WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/axis-builder) for community support, and for customisations we recommend one of the following services:

- [Codeable](https://codeable.io/)

## Getting Started

## Making Changes

* Make the changes to your forked repository.
  * **Ensure you stick to the [WordPress Coding Standards](http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/php/).**

* Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request on the master branch of the Axis Builder repository. Existing maintenance branches will be maintained of by Axis Builder developers.
